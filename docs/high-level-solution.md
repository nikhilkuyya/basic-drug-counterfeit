Item Level SKUs' Traceable system with tamper proof solution

## How tamper proof solution 

- We are building the Item level SKU identifier barcode.
- Each SKU's is traceable as we store transaction history.
- We are using tamper evident technology hyperledger fabric to build the solution.

## Why Blockchain

- ### Distributed

  - stackholders nature are competitor to each other and central database can make vunerable and significant impact for the end user as well as business process.

- ### Hashing

  - Privacy of data is importance to themself.

- ### Tamper Evidence

  - Data cannot be tampered, once it has been kept without noticed.

### Why HyperLedger Fabric

- It is private as specific stackeholder, specific transaction are required to some participants.
- Features which supports building and minor customization for the purpose.

- As core logic is handled by hyperledger fabric.
- Interact with logic with available by building application using REST services and interfaces.

***SKU*** - Stock keeping unit
