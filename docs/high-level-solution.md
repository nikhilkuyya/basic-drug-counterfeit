# Problem Solution

Item Level SKUs' Traceable system with tamper proof solution

### How tamper proof solution 
- We are building the Item level SKU identifier barcode.
- Each SKU's is traceable as we store transaction history.
- We are using tamper evident technology hyperledger fabric to build the solution.

### Why HyperLedger Fabric.
- It is private as specific stackeholder, specific transaction are required to some participants.
- Features which supports building and minor customization for the purpose.


- As core logic is handled by hyperledger fabric.
- Interact with logic with available by building application using REST services and interfaces.

Note:: SKU - Stock keeping unit
